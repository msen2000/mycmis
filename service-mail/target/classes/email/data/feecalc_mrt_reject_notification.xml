					Delta Dental has received your proposed fee submission.
				</p><p>
					However our records indicate that it has been less than 12 months from your previously 
					contracted fees for at least one of the practice locations or specialty selected. 
					Therefore, we have not processed this request.

				  You may view or download the contracted Premier fees that were processed online at <a href="{6}">http://{6}</a>.
